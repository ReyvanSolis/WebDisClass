        <p>Chapter 175 – Researcher Mikuria</p>
        <p><span><b>When I was out of the bathroom</b></span>, I found my equipment stashed on the shelf nearby. Clean and neat.
            I didn’t know what happened to my filthy water drenched clothing while I was inside the bathroom. But most likely it had been washed clean with some sort of Gallian technology.</p>
            
            <p>I put them on back quickly, and returned to where Mikuria was.
            Kairos should be there as well.
            Sure enough, there they were, talking to each other while looking at the monitor. Noticing my presence, Kairos beckoned me to join them.</p>
            
            <p>[Fate, come here. Let me show you something good]</p>

            <p>Unlike before, Mikuria had a smile on her face this time. It seemed that this information was free to be disclosed to others.
            What will you show me? I’m kinda looking forward to it now,</p>
            
            <p>[Isn’t this the sketch of the research facility…]</p>
            
            <p>[What’s with that flat reaction?]</p>
            
            <p>I was disappointed. Here I am expecting to see a Gallian technology I hadn’t seen before.
            And it turned out it’s just a sketch. Please return my excitement.</p>
            
            <p>[What’s with that disappointed look? This is the research facility’s floor plan! Things like this are usually super secret stuff! You should’ve reacted like, ‘This, Mikuria-sama! Thank you very much!’ or something along that line. Right, Mikuria?]</p>
